/**
 * A data object that contains quality of service parameters for requests to the
 * FusedLocationProviderApi.
 * <p/>
 * LocationRequest objects are used to request a quality of service for location updates from the
 * FusedLocationProviderApi.
 * <p/>
 * For example, if your application wants high accuracy location it should create a location
 * request with {@link #setPriority(int)} set to {@link #PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY} and
 * {@link #setInterval(long)} to 5 seconds. This would be appropriate for mapping applications that
 * are showing your location in real-time.
 * <p/>
 * At the other extreme, if you want negligible power impact, but to still receive location updates
 * when available, then create a location request with {@link #setPriority(int)} set to
 * {@link #PRIORITY_NO_POWER}. With this request your application will not trigger (and therefore
 * will not receive any power blame) any location updates, but will receive locations triggered by
 * other applications. This would be appropriate for applications that have no firm requirement for
 * location, but can take advantage when available.
 * <p/>
 * In between these two extremes is a very common use-case, where applications definitely want to
 * receive updates at a specified interval, and can receive them faster when available, but still
 * want a low power impact. These applications should consider
 * {@link #PRIORITY_BALANCED_POWER_ACCURACY} combined with a faster
 * {@link #setFastestInterval(long)} (such as 1 minute) and a slower {@link #setInterval(long)}
 * (such as 60 minutes). They will only be assigned power blame for the interval set by
 * {@link #setInterval(long)}, but can still receive locations triggered by other applications at a
 * rate up to {@link #setFastestInterval(long)}. This style of request is appropriate for many
 * location aware applications, including background usage. Do be careful to also throttle
 * {@link #setFastestInterval(long)} if you perform heavy-weight work after receiving an update -
 * such as using the network.
 * <p/>
 * Activities should strongly consider removing all location request when entering the background
 * (for example at {@link android.app.Activity#onPause()}), or at least swap the request to a
 * larger interval and lower quality.
 * <p/>
 * Applications cannot specify the exact location sources, such as GPS, that are used by the
 * LocationClient. In fact, the system may have multiple location sources (providers) running and
 * may fuse the results from several sources into a single Location object.
 * <p/>
 * Location requests from applications with
 * {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION} and not
 * {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION} will be automatically throttled to a
 * slower interval, and the location object will be obfuscated to only show a coarse level of
 * accuracy.
 * <p/>
 * All location requests are considered hints, and you may receive locations that are more/less
 * accurate, and faster/slower than requested.
