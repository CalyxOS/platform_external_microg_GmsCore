A reboot or restart of microG does cause exposure_last_cleanup to appear, but this is odd. Should check into this.",

      "message": "This must have been my confusion, or something may have changed. I tried without this patch, too (used the version CalyxOS is shipping); exposure_last_cleanup is added on boot apparently, but clearing or restarting microG is not enough; I was wrong when mentioning that in the above comment.\n\nOn-boot is still a decent guarantee that exposure_last_cleanup would be available for everyone with an existing install; however, we\u0027ve enhanced the checks now anyway, so we don\u0027t need to rely on that.",
